Background in cucumber
---------------------
it is to represent a collective list of pre conditions
for all the scenarios
It allows you to add some context (info) to the scenarios
in the feature file
it can contain one or more given steps

it performs much like hooks(@before)
Runs before each scenario
Where as hook have both before and after

we can have mutiple hooks(before,after) for a scenario
but incase of background
we can only have one set of background steps per feature
in case of multiple background needed,we have write separate feature files.
